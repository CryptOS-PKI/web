// The single data-source seam for the Fleet Manager web UI. `mock` (the
// default) keeps every surface on the existing in-memory fixtures; `live`
// routes reads through the manager over Connect; `live-auth` is the same live
// path with the gateway session attached (not yet lit -- treated as `live`
// until the BFF/session wiring lands). Unset or unrecognized values fall back
// to `mock` so a missing env var never accidentally goes live.
export type FleetMode = "live" | "live-auth" | "mock";

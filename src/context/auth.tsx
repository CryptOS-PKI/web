// with a smart-card / YubiKey-backed client certificate presented by the browser
// during the TLS handshake; there is no password login. The manager verifies the
// handshake and reports the operator's identity back through WhoAmI.
//
// Signing in is deliberately an explicit action (#68). Arriving at the page
// starts anonymous and asks the API nothing, even when the browser is holding a
// perfectly good certificate: the operator presses Log in, and that is what
// resolves their identity and access level. The page itself is reachable without
// a certificate, which is the only way someone who has none can be told so.
//
// Note the browser decides *when* to present a certificate -- that happens
// during the TLS handshake, before any of this runs -- so Log in checks the
// result of that handshake rather than triggering it. A dev browser cannot
// perform smart-card mTLS at all, so mock mode resolves a fixed operator
// identity, still behind the same explicit action.
